It is typically used to communicate with small inexpensive devices such as digital thermometers and weather instruments. A network of 1-Wire devices with an associated master device is called a MicroLAN. The protocol is also used in small electronic keys known as a Dallas key or iButton.\nOne distinctive feature of the bus is the possibility of using only two wires \u2014 data and ground. To accomplish this, 1-Wire devices include an 800 pF capacitor to store charge and power the device during periods when the data line is active."

This standard uses AES encryption to enable strong, secure communications, including confidentiality and data integrity.

However, this cipher mode cannot be used securely for non-standard short messages (messages less than the key length of 16 bytes). Its security model is extensible to support new security mechanisms.\nANSI C12.22/IEEE Std 1703 define message services which are components of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) for smart grids.\nThere is also RFC 6142 for transporting C12.22 data using TCP and UDP transport over IP networks.\nThe ANSI C12.22 / IEEE Std 1703 service and domains consist of ANSI C12.22 / IEEE Std 1703 Network Segments and ANSI C12.22 / IEEE Std 1703 Nodes that are managed by distributed trusted centers, network relays and gateways. As smart grid AMI networks evolve, ANSI C12.22 / IEEE 1703 domains may be created to service the utilities' Field Area Networks (FAN) and the Home/Premise Area Networks (HAN/PAN). Nodes that operate in these domains must be registered with unique application title names (ApTitles) that need to be registered (ECMX)."

The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing (including point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe), reliability and security.AMQP mandates the behavior of the messaging provider and client to the extent that implementations from different vendors are interoperable, in the same way as SMTP, HTTP, FTP, etc. have created interoperable systems. Previous standardizations of middleware have happened at the API level (e.g. JMS) and were focused on standardizing programmer interaction with different middleware implementations, rather than on providing interoperability between multiple implementations. Unlike JMS, which defines an API and a set of behaviors that a messaging implementation must provide, AMQP is a wire-level protocol. A wire-level protocol is a description of the format of the data that is sent across the network as a stream of bytes. Consequently, any tool that can create and interpret messages that conform to this data format can interoperate with any other compliant tool irrespective of implementation language."

Predominately used in France and captured by French Electrical Standard NF C 46620, it provided layers 1, 2 and 7 of the OSI model. Approximately 500,000 BatiBus network units were installed, mainly in France.\nBatiBus communicated over twisted pair lines and in topologies that could be divided into several segments. Each segment was powered with a 15 volt power supply rated at 150 milliamps. A device (node) could be reached at one of 240 possible addresses. In addition, 16 group addresses could be established under which all nodes in a group could be reached. The nodes avoided data collisions via CSMA/CA and had data flow controls. The maximum data transfer rate was 4800 bits/s.\n\n"

The polling scheme used by BSAP makes sure that each node in the network has an equal priority for requests and responses. BSAP also provides a mechanism of global addressing of all nodes connected for special messages like time synchronization apart from the normal individual addressing schemes. BSAP supports remote database access methods for reading and writing the memory in groups. It also supports multiple messaging schemes in which each node can transfer the node to other networks transparently and can transmit the responses in similar manner."

This improves the reliability of command transmission and makes C-Bus far more suitable for large, commercial applications than X10."

In this hierarchy the upper levels for production managements are linked to the direct control level of programmable logic controllers (PLC) via a non-time-critical communications system (e.g. Ethernet). The fieldbus links the PLCs of the direct control level to the components in the plant of the field level such as sensors, actuators, electric motors, console lights, switches, valves and contactors and replaces the direct connections via current loops or digital I/O signals. The requirement for a fieldbus are therefore time-critical and cost sensitive. Since the new millennium a number of fieldbuses based on Real-time Ethernet have been established. These have the potential to replace traditional fieldbuses in the long term."

HART is widely used in process and instrumentation systems ranging from small automation applications up to highly sophisticated industrial applications.\nAccording to Emerson, due to the huge installation base of 4\u201320 mA systems throughout the world, the HART Protocol is one of the most popular industrial protocols today. HART protocol has made a good transition protocol for users who wished to use the legacy 4\u201320 mA signals, but wanted to implement a \"smart\" protocol.\nThe protocol was developed by Rosemount Inc., built off the Bell 202 early communications standard in the mid-1980s as a proprietary digital communication protocol for their smart field instruments. Soon it evolved into HART and in 1986 it was made an open protocol. Since then, the capabilities of the protocol have been enhanced by successive revisions to the specification.\n\n"

It was developed for industrial applications, is relatively easy to deploy and maintain compared to other standards, and places few restrictions - other than the datagram (packet) size - on the format of the data to be transmitted.\nThe Modbus protocol uses character serial communication lines, Ethernet, or the Internet protocol suite as a transport layer.\nModbus supports communication to and from multiple devices connected to the same cable or Ethernet network. For example, there can be a device that measures temperature and another device to measure humidity connected to the same cable, both communicating measurements to the same computer.\nModbus is often used to connect a plant/system supervisory computer with a remote terminal unit (RTU) in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in the electric power industry. Many of the data types are named from industrial control of factory devices, such as Ladder logic because of its use in driving relays: A single physical output is called a coil, and a single physical input is called a discrete input or a contact.\nThe development and update of Modbus protocols have been managed by the Modbus Organization since April 2004, when Schneider Electric transferred rights to that organization. The Modbus Organization is an association of users and suppliers of Modbus-compliant devices that advocates for the continued use of the technology. Modbus Organization, Inc. is a trade association for the promotion and development of Modbus protocol."

The specification was released in April 2009. By contrast, the related OpenHAN standard for home area networks was promoted by utilities themselves and is an attempt to reconcile various home control technologies including X10, Insteon, P1901 and HomePlug.\nAn Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR) outreach collaborative was eventually formed in October 2010 and a related OpenADR Alliance [1] \"to accelerate the development, adoption and compliance of OpenADR standards throughout the energy industry\" and \"provide common language\" for smart meters. The effort sought publicity for its attempt to unify smart grid plans under a common standards umbrella to form a viable cleantech industry with a relatively level playing field. As NIST and NERC were committed to the OpenADR approach all along and the National Broadband Plan (United States) required (in its \"goal 6\") open access to consumer power use data by ADR providers, there was probably little doubt of the standards influence."

OPC specifies the communication of real-time plant data between control devices from different manufacturers.\nAfter the initial release in 1996, the OPC Foundation was created to maintain the standards. Since OPC has been adopted beyond the field of process control, the OPC Foundation changed the name to Open Platform Communications in 2011. The change in name reflects the applications of OPC technology for applications in building automation, discrete manufacturing, process control and others. OPC has also grown beyond its original OLE implementation to include other data transportation technologies including Microsoft Corporation's .NET Framework, XML, and even the OPC Foundation's binary-encoded TCP format."

Hence, Zigbee is a low-power, low data rate, and close proximity (i.e., personal area) wireless ad hoc network.\nThe technology defined by the Zigbee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth or more general wireless networking such as Wi-Fi. Applications include wireless light switches, home energy monitors, traffic management systems, and other consumer and industrial equipment that requires short-range low-rate wireless data transfer.\nIts low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10\u2013100 meters line-of-sight, depending on power output and environmental characteristics. Zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones. Zigbee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking. (Zigbee networks are secured by 128 bit symmetric encryption keys.) Zigbee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device.\nZigbee was conceived in 1998, standardized in 2003, and revised in 2006. The name refers to the waggle dance of honey bees after their return to the beehive."
